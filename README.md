# REACT-PORTFOLIO

## Introduction

This is my first React portfolio. I included a Home page where a Navbar with links to the other pages. I have a projects page where my projects can be seen. I also added a contact page for companies or collaborators to contact me. I used React, React-MDL, React-router-dom, HTML5 and CSS to build out this portfolio.

My motivation for creating this web page was to show potential employers who I am personally and what I am capable of as a coder.

I do have a footer, however it is only showing on the 'projects' page, I could not figure that out in time for submission, but I will continue to work on it.

## Code Samples

        <Header className="header-color" title="Chloe Perkins" scroll>
          <Navigation>
            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
            <Link to="/projects">Projects</Link>
          </Navigation>
        </Header>
